# Zoom-bot-playing-videos

Used Python to program a bot that can automatically enter a specified Zoom room, share the screen, play a sequence of videos, then leave the room

Made use of the PyAutoGUI library for screen recognition

Design can be implemented on a VM on Google Cloud (GCP), allowing the Zoom bot to be scheduled to automatically run at a specified time each day

Initially inspired by a code of Anish-Malla.
